                            California</h3>
                        <p>In my role at the UC Santa Barbara Library, a member of the
                            <a href="https://ucospo.net/" target="_blank">UC OSPO Network</a>, I am
                            leading a multi-campus survey of more than 200 open source contributors affiliated with the
                            University of California (UC). This is the first in-depth survey of open source contributor
                            needs from the perspective of university support staff.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to making the data available, we will publish a scholarly article (anticipated
                            preprint release fall 2025).</p>

                        <p>While many universities and national labs have excellent documentation for their compute
                            clusters, that documentation almost universally assumes that the reader has some
                            foundational computing knowledge. I wrote this accessible introduction to high-performance
                            computing for researchers with no background in computer science.</p>
                        <p>Some colleagues at the UC Davis compute cluster liked it so much, they adapted it and
                            incorporated it into their own documentation!</p>

                        <p>While at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus, I helped design a
                            software pipeline for automatically tracking articles and datasets
                            produced by researchers at our institute. Found works are automatically added to a MongoDB
                            database, and can be curated through a user-friendly Flask application. It's a bespoke tool
                            that was never designed to
                            be used outside of Janelia, but it served our purposes, and it's still in use at Janelia
                            today.</p>

                            Campus, I interviewed 60 scientists about their data management needs. I
                            summarized this qualitative survey in an internal report and multiple talks. This project
                            helped catalyze a reorganization of the Janelia Library.</p>

                                documenting the data management behaviors of an entire institution, but even fewer will
                                do it in a way that creates something genuinely useful. It's two years old now, and I
                                still find myself regularly referencing Virginia's 'Discovery' report when I want to
                                gain some insight on approaches to open data at Janelia."</p>
